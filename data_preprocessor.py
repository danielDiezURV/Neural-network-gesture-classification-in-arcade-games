    # The normalization process consists of three steps:
    # 1. Position Normalization: Centers the landmarks around the wrist (landmark 0).
    # 2. Scale Normalization: Scales the landmarks based on the maximum distance
    #     from the wrist to any other landmark, making the gesture scale-invariant.
    # 3. Wrist Removal: Removes the wrist landmark since it becomes (0, 0, 0) after normalization.
    #
    # Args:
    #     landmarks (np.ndarray): A (21, 3) numpy array of hand landmarks.
    #
    # Returns:
    #     np.ndarray: A (20, 3) numpy array of normalized hand landmarks without the wrist (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).

    #
    # The process involves two steps:
    # 1. Flattening: Converts the (20, 3) matrix into a 1D vector of 60 elements.
    # 2. Rounding: Truncates the floating-point values to 4 decimal places for consistency.
